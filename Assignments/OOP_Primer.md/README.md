Abstraction- Data abstraction means hiding the details about the data and control abstraction means hiding the implementation details

Atributes and properties- Attributes are data members inside a class or an object that represent the different features of the class.

Class- template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object

Class variable- this is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

Composition- this the idea that a class is composed of other classes

constructor- this is function used to create and instance of a class or in other words an object

encampsulation- this is the coupling of data and methods in to an object ; this object can restrict access to these things or make them public;

Friends- this is a function that allows a function to have access to another classes private data members

inheritance- the ablity for class to absorb or inherit the methods and data of another class

instance variable - variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks.

Member variable-is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods

Method- a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class

mulitple inheritance- is the class inheriting data from multiple base classes.

object - this is an instance of a class

overloading- this is taking the function of the same name but giving it differnet parameters

polymorphism- static/compile-time: this includes overloading functions and operator overloading.
dynamic/ Run-time: this includes using the virtual keyword which allows the new class to redefine them and function overriding, which is using the same function with the same return type, name, and parameters but with different implementation; Has to have a pointer

Public/private / protected- these are access levels of a class. public allowing everything to access it, privaite allowing no one but the class and friends of the class to access it/ and protected allowing the class it self and the class that inherit that class to access it.

virtual- this is a funciton that gives the inheriting class to override the funciton.
